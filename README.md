# Tree-Sitter-Blade

## Introduction (feel free to skip)

This project aims to write the tree-sitter grammar for Laravel Blade
since there is none available at the moment. It is currently in beta,
until I get some feedback from the community, so far It has passed my
own stress tests. The grammar is up to date as of **_Laravel 10.x_**

I am using **_Nova_** editor by **Panic** ü§ò and also working on an
all in one
[Laravel extension for Nova](https://github.com/EmranMR/Laravel-Nova-Extension)
in parallel hence the need for the tree-sitter-blade grammar. That
project is not yet public due to Nova's php injection shortcomings. I
will post updates as soon as the problem is fixed by Panic.

However I decided to release this project in advance considering that
a lot of amazing new editors are now tree-sitter based, and there is a
[demand for the blade support](https://github.com/laravel/framework/discussions/45286)

As a result this should be universally suitable for all editors
including **NeoVim**, and hopefully in the future **Zed** (RIP _Atom_
ü™¶).

I would be more than happy to collaborate with people experienced with
any of those editors. Please raise an
[issue](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/issues) with
detailed examples of what you are trying to achieve.

If you found this project helpful, I would really appreciate if you
can [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/EmranMR) me so that I could
keep maintaining and improving the grammar to include the entire
Laravel ecosystem inlcluding Livewire, Inertia and so forth.
Furthermore keeping the project up to date with future releases of
Laravel.

## How to inject languages:

When you parse your code there are three main important injection
points. There is an example in the `queries/injection.scm`. For ease
of use I have narrowed everything down to the following rules/queries:

#### 1. (html)

-   You need to inject html in the `(html)` nodes
-   make sure it is `(#set! injection.combined)`

#### 2. (php)

-   You inject php into `(php)` nodes. This is for all the php
    directives including `{{ x }}`, `{!! x !!}} ` and so forth
-   Optional: `(#set! injection.combined)` but considering laravel
    will render the different `php` points like havin multiple
    `<?php code ?>` The codes should have the same scope. In Nova you
    also get extra autocompletion which are built-in.

### 3. (parameter)

-   This is also a php injection point. I initially had this aliased
    as `(php)` however decided to keep it separate.
-   This is for all the inline directives such as `@extends(x)`,
    `@yield(x)` and so forth
-   you inject `php` in `(parameter)` to get a nice syntax
    highlighting
-   Do _NOT_ add `(#set! injection.combined)`
-   Because they are _parameter_. this is just for syntax highlighting
    and getting nice `php` autocompletion if needed.

### 4. (javascript)

-   TBA
-   I would really appreciate if anyone experienced with **_inertia_**
    or any other `javascript` front-end raise an
    [issue](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/issues) and
    discuss the regions that are points of interest for injection.
-   I am more of a TALL (**_tailwind, alpinejs, laravel and
    livewire_**) person and I will add alpineJS support shortly so
    that `javascript` is injected into your `alpineJS` directives,
    such as `x-data` üòè

## How to Highlight:

For ease of use, I managed to boil everything down to the following
tree-sitter queries:

#### 1. (directives)

-   This is your keywords like `@csrf` or inline directives such as
    `@extends()`
-   By highlighting `(directive)` you are painting `@extends` in
    `@extends(x)` and the keywords

#### 2. (directive_start)

-   This is for multiline directives such as `@php x @endphp`
-   this will specifically target the `@php`

#### 3. (directive_end)

-   This is also for multiline directives such as `@php x @endphp`
-   However it will target the closing directive such as `@endphp`

#### 4. (comment)

-   This is your comments `{{-- x --}}`
-   so you can add a capture for comment highlight to this query using
    `(comment)`

## Folding

The grammar is written in a way so that you can easily add folding
functionality. All you have to do is to mark the regions between
`(directive_start)` and `(directive_end)`

I am not sure what sort of capture groups other editors use for
folding, so please do let me know and I will add the `folds.scm` in
the `queries/`

I will however put an example once I write one for Nova.

## Quick Note about `queries/` folder

I would like some input from **_NeoVim_** users on how they deal with
queries and `queries/` folder. If the editor uses the queries stored
in the `queries/` from this repo, more than happy to accept any pull
requests with regards to that. At the moment all the `.scm` files in
that folder are just stubs. üî¥

## Contribution

See the [contribution](/CONTRIBUTION.md) guidelines for more details,
as well as in depth info about the `grammar` itself. Please note, if
you are contributing to the `grammar.js` file, I would start accepting
the pull requests once, I have finished writing the tests
`test/corpus`

## Todos

-   [ ] Support Livewire ü™º
-   [ ] Write the tests
-   [ ] support AlpineJS
-   [ ] support for Javascript injection points (examples needed from
        the users please raise an
        [issue](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/issues))
-   [ ] Write the queries (examples needed example needed from the
        users, please raise an
        [issue](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/issues))

<!-- ## For Nova Contributors & Issues

Head over to this repo:

-   [blade extension for Nova](https://github.com/EmranMR/nova-blade)

You need to compile the parser to `.dylib` and then copy it in the
`Syntax/` folder of the extension.

You can download the build script here:
[**Parser Build Script**](https://docs.nova.app/syntax-reference/build_script.zip)

Please refer to the README file in that repo for more information
about contributing and using the build script. -->
